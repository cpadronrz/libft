📌 DESCRIPTION

Libft is the first project of the 42 cursus. The goal is to build your own C library by re-implementing standard C library functions, along with additional utilities for memory handling, strings, and linked lists that will be used for future projects.
This project ensures a solid understanding of low-level behavior and prepares you for more complex projects.
